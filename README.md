# COMP 6651 Algorithm Design Techniques Project by Beavan Joe Mathias(40274832), Slade Justin Ferrao(40275410) and Smridhi Verma(40266036) (Winter'24)

## Components

1. `generateGraph.py`: This file contains the logic to generate the graphs with number of vertices as 300, 400 an 500 and store them in files of format .edges and .mtx

2. `Driver.py`: This File contains all the main execution methods, i.e. the calling functions for generating graphs, calculating the LCC, the optimal r value, Maximum and Average degree of LCC, and all the LSP algorithms

3. `DFSLSP.py`, `DijkstraLSP.py`, `AStarLSP.py`, `OwnHeuristicLSP.py`: These files contain the main logic of the corresponding algorithms

## To Run

1. In Terminal or IDE of your choice, Execute the `Driver.py` file. Please ensure that python is installed on the system

2. Once you execute the Driver file, you will be presented with a menu to choose from.

3. To check the the overall execution with the combined results of all algorithms on all the required graph files, select the option `6`.
